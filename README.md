# Show me the code!

A Chrome extension that displays size data on Github repository pages using data
from the Github public API.

Here's a screen shot for what it looks like right now (for this repository):

Because Chrome extensions run in an isolated environment, this extension
requires a stand-alone copy of jQuery.  I didn't include it in the hosted
repository due to its size, but if you want to clone this repo and give the
extension a try just download jQuery 2.1.1 and place it in
`vendor/jquery-2.1.1.min.js` (as specified in the manifest).
