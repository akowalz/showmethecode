# Show me the code!

A Chrome extension that displays file and directory size information on Github repository pages using data
from the Github public API.

Here's a screen shot for what it looks like right now (for this repository):

To use yourself in development mode:

1. Clone the repository
2. Point Chrome to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable the "Developer Mode" checkbox in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked extensions", grab the directory from the file system

The extension should active on any page that matches `github.com/*/*`.  Let me know if there's any funkiness!
